That command compares what is in your working directory with what is in your staging area. The result tells you the changes you’ve made that you 
haven’t yet staged.

If you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can use git diff --staged. This command compares your staged changes to 
your last commit:

$ git diff --staged
diff --git a/README b/README
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..03902a1
